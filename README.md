Hi! Iâ€™m Anurag, an aspiring data analyst who loves working with numbers, solving problems, and uncovering hidden stories in data.

Iâ€™m currently sharpening my skills through online courses and hands-on personal projects. My toolkit includes:

- **SQL** â€“ for querying and manipulating data  
- **Python** â€“ for data cleaning, analysis, and automation  
- **Excel** â€“ for dashboards, data wrangling, and quick insights  

I enjoy working with real-world datasets, cleaning messy data, and turning it into valuable insights through visualizations and analysis.

ðŸš€ **Passionate about continuous learning**, Iâ€™m looking for opportunities to grow, apply my skills, and contribute to impactful projects.

If youâ€™re working in **data or analytics**, Iâ€™d love to **connect and learn from your journey**!
